## Annotation Details

We invite 20 participants to assess dialogue quality from the sampled dialogues resorting to four overall goals of CRS at the dialogue level.  We design a questionnaire containing 5 questions covering the main overall goals of CRS, which refers to the *effectiveness*, *efficiency*, *dialogue quality*, *satisfaction* and *overall*. The annotators are asked to answer these questions for all dialogues only based on conversation. Two different annotators annotate each response, and if there is a disagreement between them, the third annotator will involve.
